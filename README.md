Prepare a titanic and Heart dataset for training with machine learning algorithm by applying suitable data preprocessing techniques.
1]Perform basic EDA using functions like head(), tail(), describe(), shape.
2]Identify & handle missing value.
3]Check for duplicates and handle it.
4]Identify outliers & handle it.
5]Apply data encoding technique on suitable attribute.
6]Apply Univariate, Bivariate & Multivariate analysis
7]Apply feature scaling technique on suitable attribute. Split the dataset in the ratio of 80:20
